## Executive Summary – Product Relationship Analysis

1. Product Category Drives Significant Sales Variation

Sales are not evenly distributed across product categories.
Certain Item Types consistently outperform others, indicating that focusing inventory and marketing efforts on high-performing categories will yield immediate ROI.

2. Outlet Characteristics Strongly Influence Sales

Outlets differ significantly in performance:

Outlet Type shows a clear sales gradient — modern retail formats outperform older or smaller formats.

Outlet Size correlates positively with sales; larger outlets generate higher average revenue, likely due to broader assortments and better footfall.

Higher-tier locations (urban/metropolitan) outperform Tier 2 & Tier 3, showing the impact of demographics on demand.

3. Product Visibility Has Mixed Impact on Sales

Your scatter plot shows a weak correlation between visibility and sales, suggesting:

High visibility does NOT always translate into higher sales.

Some high-visibility items may be staples kept in stock but not purchased frequently.

This indicates opportunities to improve merchandising strategy, especially for slow-moving but high-visibility products.

4. Item Weight Has No Strong Relationship with Sales

Weight-based items (fruits, vegetables, packaged goods) do not show a consistent trend with sales volumes.
This suggests weight is not a primary decision factor for customers.

5. Fat Content Shows Predictable Performance Patterns

Sales vary by Item Fat Content, with:

Regular-fat items often selling more than low-fat variants.

This aligns with mass-market consumer preferences, especially in general grocery environments.

This insight helps in demand forecasting and stocking decisions.

6. Category Mix Matters More Than Individual Attributes

From your barplots:

Item Type is the strongest driver of sales among all product-level features.

This indicates that customer choices are category-driven (e.g., dairy, snacks, beverages) rather than driven by product micro-features like weight or fat content.

7. Outlet Establishment Year Has Limited Impact

Older outlets do not consistently outperform or underperform newer ones.
This suggests:

Performance is more influenced by location and type rather than age.

## High-Level Business Recommendations
1. Focus on Best-Performing Product Categories

Increase inventory depth and visibility for categories with the highest average sales.

2. Tailor Outlet Strategy by Format and Location

Since outlet type and location strongly affect revenue:

Expand assortments in high-performing outlets

Optimize SKUs in lower-tier or smaller outlets

3. Improve Merchandising for Low-Selling High-Visibility Products

Revisit planograms and promotions for items with high visibility but low sales.

4. Optimize Low-Fat vs Regular Category Pricing

Given the sales patterns, regular-fat items may require better promotional planning or stock priority.
